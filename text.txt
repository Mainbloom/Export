<map>
version: The TMX format version. Was “1.0” so far, and will be incremented to match minor Tiled releases.
tiledversion: The Tiled version used to save the file (since Tiled 1.0.1). May be a date (for snapshot builds). (optional)
class: The class of this map (since 1.9, defaults to “”).
orientation: Map orientation. Tiled supports “orthogonal”, “isometric”, “staggered” and “hexagonal” (since 0.11).
renderorder: The order in which tiles on tile layers are rendered. Valid values are right-down (the default), right-up, left-down and left-up. In all cases, the map is drawn row-by-row. (only supported for orthogonal maps at the moment)
compressionlevel: The compression level to use for tile layer data (defaults to -1, which means to use the algorithm default).
width: The map width in tiles.
height: The map height in tiles.
tilewidth: The width of a tile.
tileheight: The height of a tile.
hexsidelength: Only for hexagonal maps. Determines the width or height (depending on the staggered axis) of the tile’s edge, in pixels.
staggeraxis: For staggered and hexagonal maps, determines which axis (“x” or “y”) is staggered. (since 0.11)
staggerindex: For staggered and hexagonal maps, determines whether the “even” or “odd” indexes along the staggered axis are shifted. (since 0.11)
parallaxoriginx: X coordinate of the parallax origin in pixels (defaults to 0). (since 1.8)
parallaxoriginy: Y coordinate of the parallax origin in pixels (defaults to 0). (since 1.8)
backgroundcolor: The background color of the map. (optional, may include alpha value since 0.15 in the form #AARRGGBB. Defaults to fully transparent.)
nextlayerid: Stores the next available ID for new layers. This number is stored to prevent reuse of the same ID after layers have been removed. (since 1.2) (defaults to the highest layer id in the file + 1)
nextobjectid: Stores the next available ID for new objects. This number is stored to prevent reuse of the same ID after objects have been removed. (since 0.11) (defaults to the highest object id in the file + 1)
infinite: Whether this map is infinite. An infinite map has no fixed size and can grow in all directions. Its layer data is stored in chunks. (0 for false, 1 for true, defaults to 0)
The tilewidth and tileheight properties determine the general grid size of the map. The individual tiles may have different sizes. Larger tiles will extend at the top and right (anchored to the bottom left).
A map contains three different kinds of layers. Tile layers were once the only type, and are simply called layer, object layers have the objectgroup tag and image layers use the imagelayer tag. The order in which these layers appear is the order in which the layers are rendered by Tiled.
The staggered orientation refers to an isometric map using staggered axes.
The tilesets used by the map should always be listed before the layers.
Can contain at most one: <properties>, <editorsettings> (since 1.3)
Can contain any number: <tileset>, <layer>, <objectgroup>, <imagelayer>, <group> (since 1.0)
<editorsettings>
This element contains various editor-specific settings, which are generally not relevant when reading a map.
Can contain at most one: <chunksize>, <export>
<chunksize>
width: The width of chunks used for infinite maps (default to 16).
height: The width of chunks used for infinite maps (default to 16).
<export>
target: The last file this map was exported to.
format: The short name of the last format this map was exported as.
<tileset>
firstgid: The first global tile ID of this tileset (this global ID maps to the first tile in this tileset).
source: If this tileset is stored in an external TSX (Tile Set XML) file, this attribute refers to that file. That TSX file has the same structure as the <tileset> element described here. (There is the firstgid attribute missing and this source attribute is also not there. These two attributes are kept in the TMX map, since they are map specific.)
name: The name of this tileset.
class: The class of this tileset (since 1.9, defaults to “”).
tilewidth: The width of the tiles in this tileset, which should be at least 1 except in the case of image collection tilesets (in which case it stores the maximum tile width).
tileheight: The height of the tiles in this tileset, which should be at least 1 except in the case of image collection tilesets (in which case it stores the maximum tile height).
spacing: The spacing in pixels between the tiles in this tileset (applies to the tileset image, defaults to 0). Irrelevant for image collection tilesets.
margin: The margin around the tiles in this tileset (applies to the tileset image, defaults to 0). Irrelevant for image collection tilesets.
tilecount: The number of tiles in this tileset (since 0.13). Note that there can be tiles with a higher ID than the tile count, in case the tileset is an image collection from which tiles have been removed.
columns: The number of tile columns in the tileset. For image collection tilesets it is editable and is used when displaying the tileset. (since 0.15)
objectalignment: Controls the alignment for tile objects. Valid values are unspecified, topleft, top, topright, left, center, right, bottomleft, bottom and bottomright. The default value is unspecified, for compatibility reasons. When unspecified, tile objects use bottomleft in orthogonal mode and bottom in isometric mode. (since 1.4)
tilerendersize: The size to use when rendering tiles from this tileset on a tile layer. Valid values are tile (the default) and grid. When set to grid, the tile is drawn at the tile grid size of the map. (since 1.9)
fillmode: The fill mode to use when rendering tiles from this tileset. Valid values are stretch (the default) and preserve-aspect-fit. Only relevant when the tiles are not rendered at their native size, so this applies to resized tile objects or in combination with tilerendersize set to grid. (since 1.9)
A tileset can be either based on a single image, which is cut into tiles based on the given parameters, or a collection of images, in which case each tile defines its own image. In the first case there is a single child <image> element. In the latter case, each child <tile> element contains an <image> element
If there are multiple <tileset> elements, they are in ascending order of their firstgid attribute. The first tileset always has a firstgid value of 1. Since Tiled 0.15, image collection tilesets do not necessarily number their tiles consecutively since gaps can occur when removing tiles.
Can contain at most one: <image>, <tileoffset>, <grid> (since 1.0), <properties>, <terraintypes>, <wangsets> (since 1.1), <transformations> (since 1.5)
Can contain any number: <tile>
